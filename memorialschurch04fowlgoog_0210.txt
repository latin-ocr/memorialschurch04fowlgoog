tion, allowing him to be benefieed. It is stated in the docu-
ment that Scrope was 01 a noble family, and sixteen years 01
age. On March 12 following he was presented by the King to
the 0101101 Nunwick at Ripon, and on the following day was
instituted to the rectory of Catton, at the presentation of John
Duae 01 Bedford. The death of Adam Fenrother vacated both
pieees of preferment. (Reg. Bowet, ii. 26-27, where, however,
the prebend is said to be Sharow.) On October 23, 1431,
he was collated to the stallos Asgarby at Lincoln (Le Neve, vol.
ii. p. 102), which he erchanged on August 31, 1437, with
William Adam, for the living of Middleton Chenduit (MSS.

195

Harl. 6952, 75 a). On June 22, 1448, Scrope erchanged ·

his stall 01 Langstow or Stow Longa at Lincoln with Henry
Hanslape 101 the prebend of Skipwith at Howden and the
rectory of Middleton Harpham. (Reg. Kempe at York, 64 c.)

Scrope was also Archdeacon of Durham (Le Neve, vol. iii. p. ⁹

304), and residentiary at Beverley and Ripon. On August 5,
1421, he was instituted at the presentation 01 Margery Lady
Serope of Masham to the free chapel 01 West Witton (MSS.

Harl. 6978, 18 a). In December 1428, he resigned it, but .

was instituted to it again 011 the presentation 01 John Lord
Scropc, March 4, 1437-8. (lbid. 220, 25 b.) On August
30, 1452, he was instituted to the rectory 01 Goldsbrough, which
he held till he died. (Reg. Archid. Richmond. 22 b, 430.)
ln 1457 he resigned the mastership of St. Leonard's Hospital,
York, (MSS. Cotton, Vesp. F. xiii. 36.) The wish to
supprcss the honours that were paid toArchbishop Scrope would
destroy William Scrope’s chance 01 holding preferment in York
Minster. He is mentioned in the will 01 his brother, John Lord
Scrope, in 1453. (Test. Ebor. vol. ii. p. 190.) Ηο was buried
in St. Stephen’s chapel, in York Minstcr, under a blue stone
about two yards long, with an inscription on a brass plate in
the ceutre. At each corner was a shield of arms, az. a bend or,
a file 01 three points argent. ‘⁶ Hic jacet Mag‘.Will’s le Scrope,
