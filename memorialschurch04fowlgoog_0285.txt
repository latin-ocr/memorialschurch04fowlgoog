Mauoarats OF RIPON.

Ripon, January 31, 1675-6, and was installed the next day.
On February 6, 1686-6, he preached a sermon at Ripon upon
King James the Second’s inauguration, from l Kings viii. 66,
which Dr. Batteley (afterwards archdeacon 01 Canterbury)
refused to license, and Sir Jonathan Jennings, an alderman
of Ripon, went to Dr. Batteley on purpose to return thanks to
him for such refusal. (Hutchinson's Barbam, vol. i. p. 188.) He
held the deanery until he was consecrated bishop 01 Chester

. at lambet-h, together with Dr. John Lloyd to St. David's and

Dr. Samuel Parkerto Oxford, October 17, 1686. The conse-
crating bishops were the Archbishop 01 Canterbury and the
Bishops of Durham, Norwioh, Ely, and Rochester. Burnet
states that ‘some of the bishops brought to the Primate articles
against Cartwright and Parher, which they desired he would
offer to the King in 60111011, and pray that the mandate for
consecrating them might be delayed till time was given to
examine particulam? He adds that Bishop Lloyd told him
‘that Archbishop Sancroft promised him not to consecrate them
till he had examined the truth of the articles, 01 which some
were too scandalous 10 be repeated. Yet, when the archbishop

' saw what danger he might incur if he were sued in a praemunire,

he consented to consecrate them.' Hearne says he was, ‘by
the favour 01 King James ΙΙ, made bishop 01 01100101, and one
of the Commissioners, and one who came down to turn out the
Fellows 01 Magdalen College. He has published some sermons.’
(Collections, p. 3023 011. Η101. Soc. vol. i.)¹ 10 commendam
with his bishopric‚ Gartwright retained the vicarage of Barking
and the rectory 01 Wigan, 10 which he· had been appointed by
warrant of the king, dated September 29, 1686. Soon after the
Revolution he iled to ι1011100111 France,wb0 conferred upon him
the bishoprio 01 Sarum (vacant by thc death 01 Dr. Seth Ward,
J anuary 6, 1688-9), which, however‚he never held. Following
1110 king 10 Ireland, hc landed there March 12‚1688-9,and‚
being taken with a dysentery, died on April 15, 1689, and was
buried in Christ Charch, Dublin, with great state and solemnity‚
at the charge 01 his Majesty and his party in that city.
Cartwright was one 01 the non-jurors on the accession 01
William and Mary, but his name is not usually classcd with the
bishops wbo refused to take the oath of allegiance, on account
01 his having been so constantly a temporiser. Grainger‚ in

1 1) Some four 01 five of his sermons were printed. In one of 111000 he
stands up sor the lloyal prerogativa in aa outrageous way.
