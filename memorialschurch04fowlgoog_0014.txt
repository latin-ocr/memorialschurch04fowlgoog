‘the master and abbot of that order’; he was also charged
with other offences, and hauded over ior correction to the Arch-
deacon cf Richmond, within whose jurisdiction, at Aysgarth, he
was then living. Iu the levies, etc, that were made in times
oi war with Scotland, Ripon is brought into touch with the
general history of the country.

Such are some of the principul subject-matters oi the
extracta, and, as above intimated, some readers, who may not
have time or inclination to go through the whole oi the original
matter, may find it worth while at least to look through the
side-notes and index.

The Fasti Ripouiestaea, forming the second portion oi the
volume, were originally compiled, as is stated on p. 183, by
Mr. Ward. It was intended that these collectione should form
a Surtees volume for 1861, but owing to his death, which
occurred December 4, 1861, it was ior many years abandoned.
Since the present ‘Memorials’ have been undertaken, Mr.
Ward’s family have again placed his MSS. at the disposal of
the society, and during the past year considerable additions
have been made to them from the York registers and other
sources. They have also been brought uptodate, iu continuance
of what Mr. Ward had done up to withina short time of his
death. It would not, of course, have fallen within the scope of
the society’s work to issue notices of living or lately deceased
persons, otherwise than in continuation of a work like the Fasti.
We could hardly have stopped short of the Cathedral establish-
ment; and, having mentioned that, it seemed undesirable to
stop short oi making the work complete up to the time of
publication. ¹

Itis hoped that a third and concluding volume of these
‘Memoriala' containing the very interesting account rolls and
other things which have been too long promised, will appear at
no very distant date, the materiale having long been all but
ready for the press, and only delayed by its having been thought
better to issue the Registers and Festi previously.

The Editor has now the pleasure of once more thanking
