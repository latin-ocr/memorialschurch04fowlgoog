EXTRACTS FROM THE YORK
REGISTERS.

ιιι-*-

Tne series of Archbishope' Registere at York ie complete hom
an. 1225 to the present time, with the exception of a break of
ten years after the death of Archbiehop Gray in 1255. The
first, that oi Archbiehop Gray, ie contained in two rolle called
major and minor, a description oi which will be found in
Canon Raine's Preface to hie edition of it. (Sorteee Soc. vol. lvi.)

The rect are in folio volumee, some of which are very bulky,

written on vellum. The present series of notes and extracto

has been made with especial reference to the Collegiate Church
and the Hospitals of Ripon3 but much will be found to illus-
trate the secular jurisdiction of the Archbishopa in that ancient

Liberty. No attempt hae been made to include all the col-
latione, etc.‚ recorded in the Regietere and noted by Torre.
