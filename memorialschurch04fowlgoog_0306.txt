Templo Londin. Erat ille acerrimus propugnator Religionis
Reformatae, quam filius ejus Ric. Crashaw, injuriis vexatus,
pressus inopiis, Patria extorris, et complexu Matris Ecclesiae
avulsus, abjuravit. Recensetur ille inter Benefactores Collegii
et Bibliothecae, nullos 66111611 1111166 dedisse comperio. Libri
fere omnes ejus nomine inscripti, donati erant a Com.
Southampt, ab aliis nonnulli. Certe si dedisset aliquos,
dedisset suos (6 66 scriptos). Non fecit. Animus tamen non
defuit, sed facultas, obiit enim (ut videtur) non admodum
opulentus, relictis libris 66 11116116. Filius ejus, 66111 Ρ16661
quam Poeta, reliquit nobis quaedam artis suae monumenta.¹
