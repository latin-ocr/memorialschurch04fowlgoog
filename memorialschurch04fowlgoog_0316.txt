brig. ed. Heame‚ vol. iii. p. 7823 Oxon. 8⁰ 1719.) There are
entries to the same effect in Heame’s Collections (Doble‚ vol. i.

the organist, the singing men and boys, and the two Churoh

course concerning the Worship 01 God towards the Holy Table
01Α1101,’2 ‘Apparatus ad Theologiam’ (dedicated to the Earl 01

rated in the Athenae Oxon, and which confirm the remark 01

in full from Reg. Test. Ebor. lxiii. 240.
