The Dean and these Prebendaries held a Chapter June 6,
1640, which is all the authority that I have for making the
latter 01 them the particular persons who suffered at the Dis·
solution of the Collega. Whether there are any Chaplains
belonging 10 11 00 001, I cannot say. The Prehendaries were all
of them beneficed also, but how any 01 them 10000 except Dr.
Marsh, at their several Livings,I know not. This College was
dissolved in those dismal times; 011 1100 members of it were
ν 100000 out, all the lands and 00000000, which belonged to the
Dean 000 Chapter, were sold, and 000, who called himself Dr.
Richardson, was appointed to preach in the Minster by the
Parliament, tho’ 10 011 probability he was never in any
Orders, Presbyterian 00 Episcopal. On the Restoration he went
10 Ηο11000 000 practised Physic there; and though he thus
gave way to the right owners, yet he 10, hythe Abridgement,
reckoned 00 ej acted!

Three years afterwards, however, Dr. Richardson was deeply
implicated in the Yorkshire conspiracy 100 overtumiug the
existing Government, commonly called ‘The Fameley Wood
Plot‚' from the circumstance 01 the conspirators having met there
in 10000 00 October 12, 1663,100 1100 purpose 01 advancing on
Leeds and York. Their number was 00001100 11000 was expected, y
and the next morning they retired, 00 00 010000 being given
that the King’s troops were approaching. Some were afterwards
made prisoners, but the greater part 01 1100 plotters‚ and

probably Dr. Richardson among them, took refuge 10 foreign
countries (Whittaker, Loidis et Elmete, p. 106).
