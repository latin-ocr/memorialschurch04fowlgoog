dissolution took place in the first year of Edwsrd VI, 1547-8. ·

As late as the soth Hen. v111, some years after the dis-
solution of the neighbouring monasteries, a commission was
granted hythe king empowering the archhishops of York for
the time being to visit the chnrch of Ripon, to reform in it what
should be found amiss, and to collate to each of the prehende
from time to time, as they should become vacant, a successor,
to be selected from three clerks to be recommended by the
chapter. The archbishops were also authorised hythe same
commission to dispose of the government of the hospitale of
St. John the Baptist and St. Mary Magdalene, in and near
Ripon, and to have the appointment of the masters.

After the dissolution‚ as above mentioned, the revenues of
the chnrch and chantries were seized upon hythe Crown and
added to the possessione of the Duchy of Lancaster. Out of
them a very small annual stipend was allowed for the main·
tenance of one or more ministers to carry on the parochial
duties of the town and the service of the chnrch.

The ecclesiastical affairs of Ripon continued in this de·
plorable state for more than half a century, although attempts
were made in the meantime by persons in high authority to
remedy the evil. In Queen Elisabeth’s reign Archhishop Sandys,
the Earl of Huntingdon, Lords Burleigh and Sheffield‚ Alexander
N owen, Dcan of St. Paul’s, the celebrated Hooker, snd Moses
Fowler‚ one of the parish ministers and afterwards Desn of
RiPOR, interested themselves with the queen to increase the
cnd0wment of the chnrch and to establish a college under its
prot-ection for the education of young persons intended for the
ministry3 but the scheme was opposed hythe Lord Treasurer
Buckhurst, and fell to the ground.

Early in the reign of James I. the design was again brought
forwerd, nnd the parisbioners petitioned the Queen Consort,
Anne of Denmark, for the establishment of an ecclesiastical
college ; and though in this respect they were again doomed to
disappointment, she influenced the king with effect for the re·
establishment of the collegiate chnrch.

Accordingly, on August 2, in the second year of his
reign, an. 1604, the king constituted the late dissolved chnrch
