FASTI RIPONIENsus,

-—000-—

ΤΗΕ little that ia known of the Fasti of the Churoh of Ripon
from the middle of the seventh century to the latter part of
the thirteenth‚ when the York· Registers begin to give us defi·
nite information, is to be found in the earlier portion of Vol. Ι.
The following notes, collected by the late Rev· John Ward,
Mn„ Rector of Wath, near Ripon, about twenty-six years ago,
fall into three main divisione, viz. the ‘Old’ or Mediaeval
foundation, probably dating from about the time of the Nor·
man Conquest, p. 182 ; King James's foundation of 1604; and
the ‘Neu' foundation, dating from the earliest years of the
present reign. They are now printed, with many additions and

corrections, as an important contribution to these Memorinla.
