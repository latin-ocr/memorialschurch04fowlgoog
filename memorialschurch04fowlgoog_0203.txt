Mnnomars OF RIPON.

died in 1401, and is buried at Balsham under a grey marble

alab lying in the midst of the chancel, with one of the finest
brasses in England (Lysons’ Mag. Brit. vol. ii. part l, p. 66 ς
Haines’ Mon. Brasses, vol. ii. psl). The inscription is as follows,

the contractione 01 the original being extended. It gives some
additional particulare 01 his official positione :-

›1⁴Jon Sleford dictus rector mundoque relictus,
Bursa non strictus, jacet hic sub marmore pictus,
¹ Fautor justorum constans ultor viciorum,

. Quem Rex Edwardus dilexerat, ad mala tardus,
Garderobam rexit iliius, dum bene vixit,
Ecclesiam struxit hanc, nunquam postea luxit,
Haec fecit stalla, large fundensque catalla,
Canonicus primo Wellys, Ryppon fuit imo‚¹
Edwardi festo decessit fine modesto,

Regis et Anglorum qni detulit acta reorum,²
Anno Milleno quadringeno quoque pleno,

Huic addens primum, deductum corpus ad imum.
Ο clemens Christe, coelos precor intret 01 iste,
Nil habeat triste, quia protulit omnibus iste.

(1) Blomefield suggests that as LeNevementions one John Rippon 10 have
been Archdeacon 01 Wells in 1300, 10 may 10 tha same man, 101 it was
then usual scithe clargy 10 taire names from their preferments‚ as Henry 01
IInntingdon did, from being archdeacon 01 that place.
