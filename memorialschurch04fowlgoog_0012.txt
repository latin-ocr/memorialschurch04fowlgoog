PREFAOE.

Tffis volume consiste of two distinct parts, viz. the extracts from
the Archbishops’ registers at York, and the Fasti Ripoaieases.
The former were undertaken some time ago at the suggestion
of Canon Reme, whose intimate acquaintance with the registers
enabled him to say with confidence that much might be found ·
in thern which would be of great interest in connection with
the Church of Bipon. To go through all the likely portione of
the registers, and extract the portione that seemed suitable for
our purpose, was a work of some weeks of close application day
by day, and after all itis quite likely that some matters of
great interest may have been missod. Itis hoped, however,
that what is here presented will be thought by many members
of the Surtees Society to fully justify all the labour and expense
of collecting and printing. To attempt any complete analysis
of the miscellaneous materiale for Ripon history now made
public for the first time would be almost superfluous. Anyone
running his eye along the side-notes or the columns of the
index, both of which have been made as complete as possible,
may see that we have here much that throws additional light
not only on Ripon Church history and social life, but is of
interest in connection with the history of the Church of
England and even of the country. In judging‚ however, of
the moral and religious condition of the clergy and people the

same kind of caution must be observed as was recommended in ,

the Preface to the Chapter Acts, When men kept innocency
